Guess the Number Game - Java Project
Welcome to the Guess the Number Game built with Java! In this simple console-based game, the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess the number. After each guess, the game provides feedback, telling the player whether the guess is too high or too low. The player keeps guessing until they find the correct number.

🚀 Features
Random Number Generation: The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 at the start of the game.

User Feedback: The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.

Game Continuation: The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.

Guessing Logic: The game uses a simple loop and conditional statements to check if the player’s guess is correct.

🛠 Tech Stack
Programming Language: Java

Input/Output: Console-based input/output using Scanner for user input and System.out.println for output.

Random Number Generation: Java's Math.random() is used to generate the random number.

🕹️ How To Play
Once you run the program, it will prompt you to guess the number.

Enter your guess as an integer and press Enter.

The game will inform you if your guess is too high or too low.

Keep guessing until you get the correct number, and you’ll be congratulated with a message saying, "WOOHOOO ... CORRECT".

The program will then reveal the correct number.

🎨 Customization
Range Customization: You can change the range of the random number by modifying the Math.random() formula. For example, change it to (int)(Math.random() * 500) to generate numbers between 1 and 500.

Message Customization: You can customize the feedback messages such as "YOUR NUMBER IS TOO LARGE" and "YOUR NUMBER IS TOO SMALL" to make them more personalized.

🔄 Future Enhancements
Limit Attempts: You could add a limit on the number of guesses a player can make before they lose.

Difficulty Levels: Add different difficulty levels with different number ranges (easy, medium, hard).

GUI Version: Convert the console-based game into a GUI-based game using JavaFX or Swing.
